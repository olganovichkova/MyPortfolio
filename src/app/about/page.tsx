      <p className="mb-2">
        I am currently finishing up an internship at Idaho State University
        which will be complete by March. During my last year at ISU, I got the
        opportunity to work with the geology department to create a web
        application that will serve as an inventory for their rock collection. I
        am getting hands-on experience of the web development life cycle by
        walking through it. I gained substantial experience identifying and
        fixing bugs as well as coding in JavaScript, JSX, SQL, and CSS. I am
        using the React library for the user interface and AWS services for data
        storage.

        At the same time as I was working for Idaho State University, I was a
        Software Engineer Intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This
        was a remote position where I closely worked with a scientist who
        studies DNA to identify phage genes on a genome-wide scale. My task was
        to replace the old DNA mapping tool with the new and improved mapping
        tool. I implemented a wrapper in Python that executed the new barcode
        mapping tool and pipeline in the same manner as the previous version,
        and produced similar structured outputs. My code made the jobs of
        scientists much easier by reducing the number of steps they have to
        follow manually.

        My first internship that I did was at Brightfox. The CEO of Brightfox
        wanted to add a simple check-in app that would tell arriving students
        important details such as room number, name of their tutor, and duration
        of their session. I worked with an existing API to gather appointments
        for the correct days and times. I gained practice and more skill in CSS
        and React by creating a user-friendly application for kids of all ages
        to use. I learned how to deploy applications by deploying through
        heroku.

        Throughout my academic and personal projects, I have honed my skills in
        both front-end and back-end development. I am proficient in
        problem-solving skills and thrive on the challenge of creating
        innovative solutions to complex problems. Whether it is developing
        user-friendly interfaces or optimizing database performance, I am
        committed to delivering good- quality and efficient software that meets
        the needs of users. What excites me most about software development is
        the op- portunity to continuously learn and grow in a dynamic field. I
        am eager to grow both personally and professionally as part of a team.
